## Diagram Summary

### Find Greater Among Two Numbers

> Compares two input variables and displays the greater value using a conditional check.

---

### Find Greatest Among Three Numbers

> Uses nested `if-else` statements to compare three integers and prints the largest one.

---

### Find Greatest Among Four Numbers

> Compares four integers using nested conditional statements and outputs the greatest value.

---

### Sum of First N Natural Numbers

> Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to N using a `while` loop.

---

### Factorial of a Number

> Computes the factorial of a given number by multiplying values from 1 to N using a loop.

---

### Alternating Sign Number Pattern (1 -2 3 -4 5 -6)

> Prints numbers from 1 to N with alternating positive and negative signs using a sign variable.

---

### Alternating Odd Factorial Pattern (1! -3! 5! -7!)

> Generates factorials of odd numbers with alternating signs using iterative multiplication.

---

### Incremental Number Pattern (1 12 123 1234)

> Prints increasing number sequences in each row using nested loops.

---

### Palindromic Number Pattern (1 232 34543 4567654)

> Creates a palindrome pattern by increasing numbers to the center and then decreasing them.

---

### Palindromic Number Pattern (1 121 12321 1234321)

> Prints numbers that increase from 1 to the row number and then decrease back to 1.

---

### Mixed Number Series Pattern

> Prints a Fibonacci-like sequence alternated with consecutive odd numbers.

---

### Sine Series Expansion (x − x³/3! + x⁵/5! − x⁷/7! …)

> Evaluates the sine of an angle using series expansion after converting degrees to radians.
