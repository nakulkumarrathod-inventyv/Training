## 01_logic_building
This folder is focuse on understanding logic before writing code.

- **flowchart.md**: Contains flowcharts that explain step-by-step problem solving.  
  These include basic logic (like finding the largest number), mathematical problems (factorial, Fibonacci), and number pattern generation.

---

## 02_html_css

This task is a basic **Login and Register UI** built using **HTML and CSS only**.  
Form switching is done using **CSS radio buttons**, no JavaScript used.  
The layout is responsive and beginner friendly.  
This task helps to understand layout, CSS logic, and responsive design.

---

## 03_sql_query
This folder is about practicing SQL using a movie-based database.

- **sql.md**: Includes 50 SQL queries from beginner to advanced level.
  - Basic queries using `SELECT` and `WHERE`
  - Subqueries to fetch specific data
  - Joins to connect movies, actors, directors, and ratings

## 04_javascript_tasks
This folder contains JavaScript practice tasks.

- **task_1**: Works with arrays by modifying and combining them.  
  A Promise is used to check whether the final array sum meets a condition.

- **task_3**: Similar to task_1, but uses **Symbols** as unique object keys.  
  This shows how Symbols help avoid key conflicts in objects.

## 06_angular

### Web CLI

This task is a small **Angular project** that works like an **Angular CLI terminal in browser**.  
User can type commands and see CLI-like output step by step.  
Angular **Signals** are used for state and UI control.  
This task helps to understand signals, component logic, and event handling.

### Profile Card
The Profile Card project demonstrates core Angular concepts like component-based design and data binding.  
It covers parent–child communication, lifecycle hooks, and UI state handling.  
Version-wise implementation shows the evolution from module-based Angular to standalone components and signals.  
This project helps build a strong foundation in Angular component architecture.

### Shopping Cart
The Shopping Cart project focuses on real-world state management and user interaction logic.  
It implements cart operations such as add, remove, and quantity updates using services and signals.  
Different Angular versions highlight the shift from traditional services to reactive signal-based state.  
This project is useful for understanding scalable Angular application design.
